"Chat, Cook, Connect: Unleash the Power of AI in Your Kitchen with COOKBOOK."

Cookbook Chatbot is an innovative culinary companion designed to revolutionize the way users interact with recipes and explore the world of cooking. This is an AI-driven chatbot integrated into our cookbook website.
The Cookbook Chatbot project was born out of the fast-paced digital world and the changing requirements of food enthusiasts. The goal of this chatbot is to be a multipurpose tool that helps users engage in meaningful and interesting conversations about cooking, in addition to offering recipes. 

Development Stages:
Methodologies / Models Tried So Far
1.	API’s Used:
•	GPT-3.5 API: We have utilized the GPT-3.5 API provided by Open AI to generate recipe descriptions and instructions based on input prompts. The model's vast knowledge base and language understanding capabilities have been instrumental in producing coherent and contextually relevant recipes.
•	Hugging Face LAMA: Hugging Face LAMA (Language Model Analysis) has been instrumental in evaluating and fine-tuning our language models. This tool helps us ensure that the generated recipes are not only linguistically accurate but also diverse and inclusive.
•	Google Generative AI: Leveraging Google Generative AI, we have explored advanced techniques for generating recipe variations and recommendations. This integration aims to provide users with personalized and innovative recipe suggestions tailored to their preferences.
Techniques Used:

•	Streamlit: Streamlit has been adopted for developing an interactive web interface, facilitating seamless user interaction. Users can input ingredients, recipe names, and other preferences through Streamlit, and visualize the generated recipes in real-time.

•	Langchain: Langchain, an innovative library, has been utilized to enhance the linguistic capabilities of our system further. This addition allows for more nuanced and contextually relevant recipe generation, contributing to an enriched user experience.


The project has achieved significant milestones:

•	Recipe Generation: Our platform successfully generates recipes based on input ingredients and recipe names. Users can specify ingredients, dietary preferences, and other constraints to receive customized recipes tailored to their needs.

•	Image Recognition (Ongoing): Integration of image recognition capabilities is currently underway. Once completed, users will be able to upload images of food, and the system will generate recipes based on the visual input, further enhancing the platform's versatility.

•	User Interface Development: Streamlit has enabled the creation of an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing for seamless navigation and interaction. Feedback from early users has been positive, highlighting the platform's ease of use and functionality.
